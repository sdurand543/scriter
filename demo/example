This is a short demo of scriter.

# 2
This is the scriptable iterator.

# 3
Here is the example file:
`cat example`

# 4
As you can see, the scriptable iterator allows us to execute arbitrary commands in sequence, with information.

# 5
Results of running git init:
`git init`

# 6
We can provide tips on what is going on.

# 7
Git add example:
`git add example`

# 8
Here is your new git status:
`git status`

# 9
You can also write scriter steps that interact with scriter. Here is an infinite loop.

# 10
```
function skip() {
    scr.goto 11
}
```
Use 'skip' to exit.

# 11
You have exited the infinite loop.
```
unset -f skip
```

# 12
Ideally we will add 'options' and input boxes, with insert-text support.
